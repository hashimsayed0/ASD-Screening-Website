# ASD-Screening-Website
An Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) screening website which uses eye gaze information to predict the risk level of ASD in kids

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a range of mental disorders of the neurodevelopmental type. The main symptoms of ASD are language impairment, difficulties in social interaction and repetitive behaviours.

ASD has a significant economic impact in the healthcare sector, both owing to the rise in the amount of ASD instances and owing to the time and expenses involved in the diagnosis of the patient. Early identification of ASD can help individuals and the healthcare industry by prescribing the treatment and/or drug they need, thereby lowering the long-term expenses of late diagnosis.

In an experiment, the gaze distributions of ASD subjects as well as Typically Developing (TD) subjects were collected while they were shown a 54 second long video consisting of social and non social scenes. 

Upon analysing, the gaze distributions of ASD and TD subjects were observed to be significantly different. Neural networks were trained using the collected data. After training, the neural networks were able to give predictions for new users. An ASD risk score was calculated based on this prediction. Based on this score, users were advised whether or not to go for clinical diagnosis. 

We found out that our model worked well with the data. To measure the efficiency of the algorithms, we used three distinct metrics (accuracy, precision and recall), and it seems that all metrics revealed a good classification of ASD cases. 

The website that was built based on this model proves to be an accurate and easily available screening method that uses gaze information of the user and suggests whether the child shall go for clinical diagnosis or not
